.SH NAME
procmon \- manual page for procmon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B procmon 
[\fIoptions\fR...] (standalone)
.br
.B procmond
[\fIoptions\fR...] (daemon)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBprocmon\fR application scans the table of running processes, killing those that has 
exceeds a given CPU-time limit or has gone for lunch. It is etiher runned 
periodical in single-shot mode from command line or crontab, or forked into the 
background as a daemon process (using the -b option).
.PP
The process can be controlled by sending signals when running as daemon. 
Sending SIGKILL or SIGTERM will ask the daemon to exit. Sending SIGHUP will 
force the process to immediate begin a scanning of running processes.

.br
Set process user (by name).
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-uid\fR=\fInum\fR:

.br
Permanent drop credentials (real UID and GID).
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR:

Show version.

.SH HINTS
Use \fB\-\-signal\fR=\fI0\fR together with \fB\-\-script\fR=\fIpath\fR. This 
will check the process instead of killing it. Useful if the script to 
be runned is a start/stop script.
