.SH DESCRIPTION
This application scans the table of running processes, killing those that has 
exceeds a given CPU-time limit or has gone for lunch. It is etiher runned 
periodical in single-shot mode from command line or crontab, or forked into the 
background as a daemon process (using the -b option).
.PP
The process can be controlled by sending signals when running as daemon. 
Sending SIGKILL or SIGTERM will ask the daemon to exit. Sending SIGHUP will 
force the process to immediate begin a scanning of running processes.

.SH HINT
Use \fB\-\-signal\fR=\fI0\fR together with \fB\-\-script\fR=\fIpath\fR. This 
will simply check for the existance of the process instead of killing it. This
is useful if the script to run is a start/stop script.
