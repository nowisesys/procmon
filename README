** DAEMON:

   The process can be controlled by sending signals when running as daemon.
   Sending SIGKILL or SIGTERM will ask the daemon to exit. Sending SIGHUP
   will force the process to immediate begin a scanning of running processes.

** SIGNAL & SCRIPT:

   The default action is to send a signal (SIGTERM) to each process that exceeds

   addition to signaling. The script gets executed thru system(3) with PID and
   command name as arguments.
